**UPDATE 12 JANUARY 2024:** In _Spectrum_‘s 2012 feature story, below, James Surowiecki called money in tribal economies “a social lubricant.” Or as the anthropologist David Graeber puts it in his 2011 book _[Debt: The First 5000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years)_ money helped “to define the structure of social relations.”

**2024 年 1 月 12 日更新：** 在 _Spectrum_ 2012 年的专题报道中，詹姆斯·苏罗维茨基 （James Surowiecki） 称部落经济中的货币是“一种社会润滑剂”。或者正如人类学家大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber）在他2011年出版的《_[债务：前5000年》（Debt： The First 5000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years)_）一书中所说的那样，金钱帮助“定义了社会关系的结构”。

The view of “money” as a social structural agent and social lubricant has made a comeback in recent years, too. In November, in an interview with Rachel O’Dwyer, author of _[Tokens: The Future of Money in the Age of the Platform](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money),_ she noted that digital mediums of exchange are increasingly doing double duty­—for the purposes that fit the classical definition of money, and for “something more,” as she puts it. O’Dwyer noted that people are also using digital monies to reward each other for socially valuable content online. “And this is something that really fascinates me about these tokens,” she said. “They’re money or money-ish, but they’re also a kind of social currency or social media.”  

将“金钱”视为社会结构因素和社会润滑剂的观点近年来也卷土重来。11 月，在接受_[《代币：平台时代的货币未来](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-future-of-money)_》一书的作者 Rachel O'Dwyer 的采访时，她指出，数字交换媒介越来越多地承担着双重职责——为了符合货币经典定义的目的，以及她所说的“更多东西”。O'Dwyer 指出，人们还使用数字货币来奖励彼此的在线具有社会价值的内容。“这是这些代币真正让我着迷的地方，”她说。“它们是金钱或金钱，但它们也是一种社交货币或社交媒体。”

Meanwhile, technologies like the [blockchain](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blockchain), stored value cards, and digital funds transfer services like [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) came along and proved Kublai Khan’s theory, as noted below, that that “what matters about money is not what it looks like, or even what it’s backed by, but whether people believe in it enough to use it.” Shadow economies have sprung up across the globe that sidestep fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, the Chinese yuan, and the EU’s euro. Multinational corporate giants like [Meta](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/meta) (corporate parent of [Facebook](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook)) are [looking to establish their own currencies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/facebook-cryptocurrency-diem-why) alongside government-backed money. Facebook failed with its [Diem](https://spectrum.ieee.org/facebook-cryptocurrency-diem-why)cryptocurrency coin, but [another tech giant might soon pull it off](https://spectrum.ieee.org/private-digital-currency).  

与此同时，[区块链](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/blockchain)、储值卡和 [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) 等数字资金转账服务等技术的出现证明了忽必烈汗的理论，如下所述，“货币的重要因素不是它的外观，甚至不是它有什么样的支持，而是**人们是否相信它并使用它**。影子经济体在全球范围内如雨后春笋般涌现，避开了美元、人民币和欧盟欧元等法定货币。像 [Meta](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/meta)（[Facebook](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook) 的母公司）这样的跨国企业巨头正在寻求在政府支持的资金旁边[建立自己的货币](https://spectrum.ieee.org/facebook-cryptocurrency-diem-why)。Facebook 的 [Diem](https://spectrum.ieee.org/facebook-cryptocurrency-diem-why) 加密货币失败了，但[另一家科技巨头可能很快就会成功](https://spectrum.ieee.org/private-digital-currency)。  

Last month, as _Spectrum_ reported, Bitcoin’s US $3 trillion worth of transactions in 2021 more than doubles what [American Express](https://card.americanexpress.com/d/american-express/?utm_mcid=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=%2Bamerican%20%2Bexpress&utm_cmpid=20873265297&utm_adgid=158589220722&utm_tgtid=kwd-383918390771&utm_mt=p&utm_adid=685241285434&utm_dvc=c&utm_ntwk=g&utm_plcmnt=&utm_locphysid=9004281&utm_locintid=&utm_feeditemid=&utm_devicemdl=&utm_plcmnttgt=&utm_ltpcid=Cj0KCQiAnfmsBhDfARIsAM7MKi3CFJ_5loXruQph3OxV2BP0fivuPTuP2OYiPF_fUOfqmlvaNMRc518aAn5EEALw_wcB&utm_programname=brandnps&gclid=Cj0KCQiAnfmsBhDfARIsAM7MKi3CFJ_5loXruQph3OxV2BP0fivuPTuP2OYiPF_fUOfqmlvaNMRc518aAn5EEALw_wcB) processed.

And as O’Dwyer notes in _Spectrum_‘s November interview with her, EBT cards are taking the place of food stamps. Elsewhere, people are using the [stored value on digital phone cards administered by wireless carriers](https://lifeasahuman.com/2013/media-tech/technology/mobile-minutes-exchanged-as-currency-in-africa/) as replacements for cash or debit cards. This enables them to carry out transactions even if they don’t have bank accounts and provides a measure of security against losses from pickpockets or armed robbers. —_[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/)_

_Original article from 30 May 2012 follows:  
2012 年 5 月 30 日的原始文章如下：_

**In the 13th century, the Chinese emperor** Kublai Khan embarked on a bold experiment. China at the time was divided into different regions, many of which issued their own coins, discouraging trade within the empire. So Kublai Khan decreed that henceforth [money would take the form of paper](https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324254/Kublai-Khan/3994/Social-and-administrative-policy).  

**13 世纪，中国皇帝**忽必烈汗开始了一项大胆的实验。当时的中国分为不同的地区，其中许多地区发行自己的硬币，阻碍了帝国内部的贸易。因此，忽必烈下令，从今以后[，货币将采用纸的形式](https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324254/Kublai-Khan/3994/Social-and-administrative-policy)。

It was not an entirely original idea. Earlier rulers had sanctioned paper money, but always alongside coins, which had been around for centuries. Kublai’s daring notion was to make paper money (the _chao_) the dominant form of currency. And when the Italian merchant Marco Polo visited China not long after, he marveled at the spectacle of people exchanging their labor and goods for mere pieces of paper. It was as if value were being created out of thin air.  

这并不是一个完全原创的想法。早期的统治者已经批准了纸币，但总是与已经存在了几个世纪的硬币一起。忽必烈的大胆想法是让纸币 （_chao_） 成为主要的货币形式。不久之后，当意大利商人马可·波罗（Marco Polo）访问中国时，他对人们用他们的劳动和商品换取单纯的纸片的景象感到惊叹。价值仿佛是凭空创造的。

Kublai Khan was ahead of his time: He recognized that what matters about money is not what it looks like, or even what it’s backed by, but whether people believe in it enough to use it. Today, that concept is the foundation of all modern monetary systems, which are built on nothing more than governments’ support of and people’s faith in them. Money is, in other words, a complete abstraction—one that we are all intimately familiar with but whose growing complexity defies our comprehension.  

忽必烈汗走在了时代的前面：他认识到，金钱的重要不在于它的外观，甚至不是它有什么样的支持，而是人们是否足够相信它并使用它。今天，这个概念是所有现代货币体系的基础，这些体系只建立在政府对它们的支持和人民的信任之上。换句话说，金钱是一个完全抽象的概念——我们都非常熟悉它，但其日益增长的复杂性超出了我们的理解范围。


Today, many people long for simpler times. It’s a natural reaction to a world in which money is becoming not just more abstract but more digital and virtual as well, in which sophisticated computer algorithms execute microsecond market transactions with no human intervention at all, in which below-the-radar economies are springing up around their own alternative currencies, and in which global financial crises are brought on for reasons difficult to parse without a Ph.D. Back in the day, the thinking goes, money stood for something: Gold doubloons and cowrie shells had real value, and so they didn’t need a government to stand behind them.  
今天，许多人渴望更简单的时代。这是对当今世界的自然反应，在这个世界里，货币不仅变得更加抽象，而且也变得更加数字化和虚拟化，在这个世界中，复杂的计算机算法在完全没有人工干预的情况下执行微秒级市场交易，在这个世界中，低调的经济体围绕着自己的替代货币如雨后春笋般涌现，而全球金融危机的引发原因，没有博士学位就难以分析。过去，人们认为，金钱代表着某种东西：金币和贝壳具有真正的价值，因此它们不需要政府来支持它们。

In fact, though, money has never been that simple. And while its uses and meanings have shifted and evolved throughout history, the fact that it is no longer anchored to any one substance is actually a good thing. Here’s why.  
但事实上，金钱从未如此简单。虽然它的用途和含义在整个历史中发生了变化和发展，但它不再锚定于任何一种物质这一事实实际上是一件好事。原因如下。

**Let’s start with what money** is used for. Modern economists typically define it by the three roles it plays in an economy:  
**让我们从钱**的用途开始。现代经济学家通常根据它在经济中扮演的三个角色来定义它：

- It’s a _store of value_, meaning that money allows you to defer consumption until a later date.    
    它是一种_价值储存手段_，这意味着货币允许您将消费推迟到以后。
- It’s a _unit of account_, meaning that it allows you to assign a value to different goods without having to compare them. So instead of saying that a Rolex watch is worth six cows, you can just say it (or the cows) cost $10 000.  
    它是一个_记账单位_，这意味着它允许您为不同的商品分配价值，而无需比较它们。因此，与其说一块劳力士手表值六头奶牛，不如说它（或奶牛）价值 10 000 美元。
- And it’s a _medium of exchange_—an easy and efficient way for you and me and others to trade goods and services with one another.  
    它是一种_交换媒介_ — 您、我和其他人相互交易商品和服务的一种简单有效的方式。

All of these roles have to do with buying and selling, and that’s how the modern world thinks of money—so much so that it seems peculiar to conceive of money in any other way.  
所有这些角色都与买卖有关，这就是现代世界对金钱的看法——如此之多，以至于以任何其他方式构想货币似乎很奇特。

Yet in tribal and other “primitive” economies, money served a very different purpose—less a store of value or medium of exchange, much more a social lubricant. As the anthropologist [David Graeber](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/david-graeber-on-the-invention-of-money-%E2%80%93-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics.html) puts it in his recent book _Debt: The First 5000 Years_ (Melville House, 2011), money in those societies was a way “to arrange marriages, establish the paternity of children, head off feuds, console mourners at funerals, seek forgiveness in the case of crimes, negotiate treaties, acquire followers.” Money, then, was not for buying and selling stuff but for helping to define the structure of social relations.  
然而，在部落和其他“原始”经济中，货币的作用却截然不同——与其说是价值储存手段或交换媒介，不如说是一种社会润滑剂。正如人类学家[大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/david-graeber-on-the-invention-of-money-%E2%80%93-notes-on-sex-adventure-monomaniacal-sociopathy-and-the-true-function-of-economics.html)）在他的新书_《债务：最初的5000年》（Debt： The First 5000 Years，Melville_ House，2011年）中所说，在这些社会中，金钱是“安排婚姻、建立孩子父子关系、避免世仇、在葬礼上安慰哀悼者、在犯罪情况下寻求宽恕、谈判条约、获得追随者”的一种方式。因此，金钱不是用来买卖东西的，而是用来帮助定义社会关系的结构的。

How, then, did money become the basis of trade? By the time money makes its first appearance in written records, in Mesopotamia during the third millennium B.C.E., that society already had a sophisticated financial structure in place, and merchants were using silver as a standard of value to balance their accounts. But cash was still not widely used.  
那么，货币是如何成为贸易的基础的呢？当货币首次出现在书面记录中时，在公元前三千年的美索不达米亚，社会已经建立了复杂的金融结构，商人使用白银作为价值标准来平衡他们的账户。但现金仍然没有得到广泛使用。

It’s really in the seventh century B.C.E., when the small kingdom of Lydia introduced the world’s first standardized metal coins, that you start to see money being used in a recognizable way. Located in what is now Turkey, Lydia sat on the cusp between the Mediterranean and the Near East, and commerce with foreign travelers was common. And that, it turns out, is just the kind of situation in which money is quite useful.  
实际上，在公元前 7 世纪，当小王国吕底亚 （Lydia） 引入了世界上第一枚标准化金属硬币时，您开始看到货币以一种可识别的方式使用。莉迪亚位于现在的土耳其，位于地中海和近东之间的风口浪尖，与外国游客进行贸易是很常见的。事实证明，这就是金钱非常有用的情况。

To understand why, imagine doing a trade in the absence of money—that is, through barter. (Let’s leave aside the fact that no society has ever relied solely or even largely on barter; it’s still an instructive concept.) The chief problem with barter is what economist [William Stanley Jevons](https://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnMME1.html) called the “double coincidence of wants.” Say you have a bunch of bananas and would like a pair of shoes; it’s not enough to find someone who has some shoes or someone who wants some bananas. To make the trade, you need to find someone who has shoes he’s willing to trade _and_ wants bananas. That’s a tough task.  
要理解原因，想象一下在没有钱的情况下进行交易——即通过易货交易。（让我们撇开这样一个事实，即从来没有一个社会完全甚至主要依赖以物易物;它仍然是一个具有启发性的概念。以物易物的主要问题是经济学家[威廉·斯坦利·杰文斯（William Stanley Jevons](https://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnMME1.html)）所说的“需求的双重巧合”。假设你有一堆香蕉，想要一双鞋;找到一些有鞋子的人或想要一些香蕉的人是不够的。要进行交易，您需要找到一个拥有他愿意交易_的鞋子并_想要香蕉的人。这是一项艰巨的任务。

With a common currency, though, the task becomes easy: You just sell your bananas to someone in exchange for money, with which you then buy shoes from someone else. And if, as in Lydia, you have foreigners from whom you’d like to buy or to whom you’d like to sell, having a common medium of exchange is obviously valuable. That is, money is especially useful when dealing with people you don’t know and may never see again.  
不过，使用通用货币，任务就变得简单了：您只需将香蕉卖给某人以换取金钱，然后用这些钱从其他人那里购买鞋子。如果像 Lydia 一样，你有外国人想向他们购买或出售，那么拥有一个共同的交换媒介显然是有价值的。也就是说，在与您不认识且可能再也见不到的人打交道时，金钱特别有用。

The Lydian system’s breakthrough was the standardized metal coin. Made of a gold-silver alloy called electrum, one coin was exactly like another—unlike, say, cattle. Also unlike cattle, the coins didn’t age or die or otherwise change over time. And they were much easier to carry around. Other kingdoms followed Lydia’s example, and coins became ubiquitous throughout the Mediterranean, with kingdoms stamping their insignia on the coins they minted. This had a dual effect: It facilitated the flow of trade, and it established the authority of the state.  
吕底亚系统的突破是标准化的金属硬币。一枚硬币由一种叫做金银合金的金银合金制成，与另一枚硬币完全一样——不像牛。与牛不同的是，这些硬币不会老化、死亡或随着时间的推移而变化。而且它们更容易携带。其他王国效仿吕底亚，硬币在整个地中海无处不在，王国在他们铸造的硬币上印上了他们的徽章。这具有双重效果：它促进了贸易的流动，并确立了国家的权威。

Modern governments still like to place their stamp upon money, and not just on bills and coins. In general, they prefer that money—whether physical cash or digital—be issued and controlled only by official entities and that financial transactions (especially international ones) be traceable. And so the recent rise of an alternative currency like [Bitcoin](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bitcoin) [see “[The Cryptoanarchists' Answer to Cash,](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/bitcoin-the-cryptoanarchists-answer-to-cash)" in this issue], which is based on a cryptographic code that allows for anonymous transactions and that so far has proved to be uncrackable, is the kind of thing that tends to make governments very unhappy.  
现代政府仍然喜欢在货币上盖上印记，而不仅仅是在纸币和硬币上。一般来说，他们更喜欢货币（无论是实物现金还是数字货币）仅由官方实体发行和控制，并且金融交易（尤其是国际交易）是可追溯的。因此，最近兴起的像[比特币](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/bitcoin)这样的替代货币[参见本期的“[加密无政府主义者对现金的回答](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/bitcoin-the-cryptoanarchists-answer-to-cash)”]，它基于允许匿名交易的加密代码，并且到目前为止已被证明是不可破解的，这种事情往往会让政府非常不满。

**The spread of money throughout** the Mediterranean didn’t mean that it was universally used. Far from it. Most people were still subsistence farmers and existed largely outside the money economy.  
**货币在整个**地中海的传播并不意味着它被普遍使用。远非如此。大多数人仍然是自给自足的农民，主要存在于货币经济之外。

But as money became more common, it encouraged the spread of markets. This, in fact, is one of the enduring lessons of history: Once even a small part of your economy is taken over by markets and money, they tend to colonize the rest of the economy, gradually forcing out barter, feudalism, and other economic arrangements. In part this is because money makes market transactions so much easier, and in part because using money seems to redefine what people value, pushing them to view things in economic, rather than social, terms.  
但随着货币变得越来越普遍，它促进了市场的扩张。事实上，这是历史的持久教训之一：一旦你的经济被市场和货币接管，哪怕是一小部分，它们往往会殖民经济的其余部分，逐渐驱逐以物易物、封建主义和其他经济安排。部分原因是货币使市场交易变得更加容易，部分原因是使用货币似乎重新定义了人们的价值观，促使他们从经济而不是社会的角度看待事物。

Governments were quick to embrace hard currency because it facilitated the collection of taxes and the building of military forces. In the third century B.C.E., with the rise of Rome, money became an important tool for [unifying and expanding the empire](https://www.oenb.at/en/ueber_die_oenb/geldmuseum/allg_geldgeschichte/antike/%20money_in_ancient_times.jsp), reducing the costs of trade, and funding the armies that kept the emperors in power.  
政府很快就接受了硬通货，因为它促进了税收和军队的建设。公元前 3 世纪，随着罗马的崛起，货币成为[统一和扩张帝国](https://www.oenb.at/en/ueber_die_oenb/geldmuseum/allg_geldgeschichte/antike/%20money_in_ancient_times.jsp)、降低贸易成本以及为维持皇帝统治的军队提供资金的重要工具。

The decline of the Roman Empire, starting in the third century C.E., saw a decline in the use of money as well, at least in the West. Parts of the former empire, like Britain, simply stopped using coins. Elsewhere people still used money to balance accounts and keep track of debts, and many small kingdoms minted their own coins. But in general, the circulation of money became less central, as cities shrank in size and commerce dwindled.  
罗马帝国从公元3世纪开始衰落，货币的使用也随之减少，至少在西方是这样。前帝国的部分地区，如英国，干脆停止使用硬币。在其他地方，人们仍然使用货币来平衡账户和跟踪债务，许多小王国铸造自己的硬币。但总的来说，随着城市规模的缩小和商业的萎缩，货币流通变得不那么中心。

The [rise of feudal society](https://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/feudalism.html) also undercut money’s role. The basic relationship between master and vassal was mediated not by payment for services rendered but rather by an oath of loyalty and a promise of support. Land was not bought and sold; it belonged, ultimately, to the king, who granted use of the land to his lords, who in turn provided plots of land to their vassals. And feudalism discouraged trade; a feudal estate, or fief, was often a closed community that aimed to be self-sufficient. In such a setting, money had little use.  
[封建社会的兴起](https://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/feudalism.html)也削弱了货币的作用。主人和封臣之间的基本关系不是通过提供服务的报酬来调解的，而是通过忠诚的誓言和支持的承诺来调解的。土地不是买卖的;它最终属于国王，国王将土地的使用权授予他的领主，而领主又将土地提供给他们的封臣。封建主义阻碍了贸易;封建庄园或封地通常是一个旨在自给自足的封闭社区。在这样的环境下，金钱几乎没有用处。

Money’s decline in feudal times is worth noting for what it reveals about money’s essential nature. For one thing, money is impersonal. With it, you can cut a deal with, say, [a guy named Jeff Bezos](https://www.amazon.com/), whom you don’t know and will probably never meet—and that’s okay. As long as your money and his products are good, you two can do business. Similarly, money fosters a curious kind of equality: As long as you have sufficient cash, all doors are open to you. Finally, money seems to encourage people to value things solely in terms of their market value, to reduce their worth to a single number.  
货币在封建时代的衰落值得注意，因为它揭示了货币的本质。首先，金钱是非个人的。有了它，你可以和一个[名叫 Jeff Bezos](https://www.amazon.com/) 的人达成交易，你不认识他，而且可能永远不会见过他——这没关系。只要你的钱和他的产品都好，你们两个就可以做生意。同样，金钱也促进了一种奇怪的平等：只要你有足够的现金，所有的大门都会向你敞开。最后，金钱似乎鼓励人们仅根据其市场价值来评估事物，将其价值降低到一个数字。

These characteristics make money invaluable to modern financial systems: They encourage trade and the division of labor, they reduce transaction costs—that is, the cost incurred in executing an economic exchange—and they make economies more efficient and productive. These same qualities, though, are why money tends to corrode traditional social orders, and why it is commonly believed that when money enters the picture, economic relationships trump all other kinds.  
这些特征使货币对现代金融体系无价之宝：它们鼓励贸易和劳动分工，降低交易成本——即执行经济交换所产生的成本——并使经济更加高效和多产。然而，正是这些相同的品质，就是为什么金钱往往会腐蚀传统的社会秩序，以及为什么人们普遍认为，当金钱进入画面时，经济关系胜过所有其他类型。

It’s unsurprising, then, that feudal lords had little use for the stuff. In their world, maintaining the social hierarchy was far more important than economic growth (or, for that matter, economic freedom or social mobility). The widespread use of money, with its impersonal transactions, its equalizing effect, and its calculated values, would have upended that order.  
因此，封建领主对这些东西几乎没有用处也就不足为奇了。在他们的世界里，维持社会等级制度远比经济增长（或者，就此而言，经济自由或社会流动性）重要得多。货币的广泛使用，以及其非个人化的交易、它的平等效应和它的计算价值，都会颠覆这种秩序。

**Money’s decline didn’t last,** of course. By the 12th century, even as the Chinese were experimenting with paper currency, Europeans began to embrace a new view of money: Instead of being something to hoard or spend, money became something to invest, to be put to work in order to make more money.  
当然**，Money 的衰落并没有持续**下去。到 12 世纪，即使中国人正在试验纸币，欧洲人也开始接受一种新的货币观：货币不再是囤积或消费的东西，而是成为投资的东西，用于工作以赚取更多的钱。

This idea came with a renewed interest in commerce. Trade fairs sprang up across Europe, frequented by a community of merchants who had begun to do business across the continent. This period also saw the [emergence of a banking industry in the city‑states of Italy](https://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/03.html). These new institutions introduced a host of financial innovations that we still use today, including municipal bonds and insurance. The banks fostered the use of credit and debt, which became ever more central to the economy as kings borrowed to finance their military adventures and merchants borrowed to fund their long-range trades.  
这个想法带来了人们对商业的新兴趣。贸易展览会在欧洲各地如雨后春笋般涌现，开始在整个欧洲大陆开展业务的商人社区经常光顾。这一时期还见证了[意大利城邦银行业的出现](https://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/03.html)。这些新机构引入了我们今天仍在使用的一系列金融创新，包括市政债券和保险。银行促进了信贷和债务的使用，随着国王借款为他们的军事冒险提供资金，商人借款为他们的远程贸易提供资金，信贷和债务在经济中变得越来越重要。

The [invention of the bill of exchange](https://chalaux.org/ammsuk02.htm#cinco), which laid the groundwork for the emergence of paper money in the West, also occurred during this period. The bill of exchange was a sort of precursor to the traveler’s check: a document representing a quantity of gold that could be exchanged for the real thing in a different city. Traveling merchants liked the bills because they could be carried around with far less risk (and exertion) than the precious metal.  
[汇票的发明](https://chalaux.org/ammsuk02.htm#cinco)也发生在这一时期，为西方纸币的出现奠定了基础。汇票是旅行支票的一种前身：一份代表黄金数量的文件，可以在不同的城市兑换成真金。旅行商人喜欢这些钞票，因为它们可以随身携带，风险（和精力）远低于贵金属。

By the 16th century in Europe, many of the ideas about money that shape our thinking today were in place. Still, money remained a physical thing—that thing being a piece of gold or silver. A gold coin wasn’t a _symbol_ of value; it was an _embodiment_ of it, because everyone believed that the gold had intrinsic worth. Likewise, the amount of money in the economy was still a function of how much gold and silver was available. The rulers of Spain and Portugal didn’t quite appreciate the limits of this system, however, which led them to plunder their New World colonies and accumulate vast hoards of precious metals, which in turn triggered periods of rampant inflation and enormous tumult in the European economy.  
到 16 世纪的欧洲，许多塑造我们今天思维方式的货币观念已经存在。尽管如此，金钱仍然是一种有形的东西——那东西是一块金子或白银。金币不是价值_的象征_;它是它的_体现_，因为每个人都相信黄金具有内在价值。同样，经济中的货币数量仍然是可用黄金和白银数量的函数。然而，西班牙和葡萄牙的统治者并不完全意识到这种制度的局限性，这导致他们掠夺了新大陆的殖民地并积累了大量的贵金属，这反过来又引发了欧洲经济猖獗的通货膨胀和巨大动荡的时期。

These days, countries have central banks to oversee their money supplies, as well as to set interest rates, combat inflation, and otherwise control their monetary policy. The United States has the [Federal Reserve System](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), the Eurozone has the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html), the Maldives has the [Maldives Monetary Authority](https://www.mma.gov.mv/), and so on. When the Federal Reserve wants to increase the money supply, it doesn’t have to go looking for El Dorado. Neither does it phone up the United States Mint and order it to start printing more dollars; in fact, only about 10 percent of the U.S. money supply—about $1 trillion of the roughly $10 trillion total—exists in the form of paper cash and coins.  
如今，各国都有中央银行来监督其货币供应量，以及设定利率、对抗通货膨胀以及以其他方式控制其货币政策。美国有[联邦储备系统](https://www.federalreserve.gov/)，欧元区有[欧洲中央银行](https://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html)，马尔代夫有[马尔代夫金融管理局](https://www.mma.gov.mv/)，等等。当美联储想要增加货币供应量时，它不必去寻找 El Dorado。它也没有打电话给美国造币厂，命令它开始印制更多的美元;事实上，美国货币供应量中只有大约 10%（大约是 10 万亿美元总额中的约 1 万亿美元）以纸币和硬币的形式存在。

Instead, the Fed buys government securities, such as treasury bills, on the open market, typically from regular private banks, and then credits the banks’ accounts with the money. As the banks lend, invest, and otherwise spend this new money, the overall money supply that’s circulating increases. If, on the other hand, the Reserve wants to decrease the money supply, it does the opposite: It sells government bonds on the open market, again typically to private banks, and then deducts the sales price from the banks’ accounts. The banks have less money to spend, and the money supply shrinks.  
相反，美联储通常在公开市场上购买政府证券，例如国库券，然后将这笔钱存入银行账户。随着银行借出、投资和以其他方式使用这些新货币，流通的总货币供应量会增加。另一方面，如果储备想要减少货币供应量，它就会反其道而行之：它在公开市场上出售政府债券，通常还是卖给私人银行，然后从银行账户中扣除销售价格。银行可以花的钱减少了，货币供应量也减少了。

The sophisticated and relatively opaque machinations by which central banks keep economies afloat may make the Spanish Empire’s inflationary foibles look quaintly naive. But in fact the fine-tuning of monetary policy—the delicate juggling of interest rates, money supply, and other financial mechanisms so that an economy keeps expanding at a steady, manageable rate, without excessive inflation, unemployment, debt, or boom and bust cycles—is still a work in progress, as the ongoing economic woes in both Europe and the United States demonstrate.  
中央银行维持经济运转的复杂且相对不透明的阴谋可能会让西班牙帝国的通货膨胀弱点看起来古怪地天真。但事实上，正如欧洲和美国持续的经济困境所表明的那样，货币政策的微调——利率、货币供应量和其他金融机制的微妙平衡，使经济以稳定、可控的速度持续扩张，而不会出现过度的通货膨胀、失业、债务或繁荣和萧条周期——仍然是一项正在进行的工作。

**Back to the 1600s: The view** of money as commodity began to shift only with the widespread adoption of paper currency, which found the warmest welcome in the American colonies. In 1690, for instance, the [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCurrency/CurrencyText/MA-1690-1750.html) issued paper money to fund a military campaign, and did so without explicitly promising to redeem the bills for gold or silver.  
**回到 1600 年代：**随着纸币的广泛采用，将货币视为商品的观点开始转变，纸币在美国殖民地受到了最热烈的欢迎。例如，在 1690 年，[马萨诸塞湾殖民地](https://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCurrency/CurrencyText/MA-1690-1750.html)发行纸币来资助军事行动，但并没有明确承诺将纸币兑换成金银。

Later, during the American Revolutionary War, the [Continental Congress printed “continentals”](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-issues-continental-currency) to pay for the new country’s war debts. These bills were in principle backed by gold, but so many were issued that their collective value far exceeded the available gold. When soldiers and merchants discovered they’d been paid in near-worthless scrip, it inspired a backlash against paper money; the [U.S. Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html), for instance, prohibited states from using any other money than gold and silver coins. It wasn’t until 1862, during the Civil War, that Congress finally passed a law allowing the government to print paper money, or “greenbacks.”  
后来，在美国独立战争期间，[大陆会议印制了“大陆](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/congress-issues-continental-currency)”来支付新国家的战争债务。这些票据原则上以黄金为后盾，但发行的票据数量如此之多，以至于它们的总价值远远超过了可用的黄金。当士兵和商人发现他们得到的报酬几乎毫无价值时，它激发了对纸币的强烈反对;例如，[美国宪法](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html)禁止各州使用除金币和银币以外的任何其他货币。直到 1862 年南北战争期间，国会才终于通过了一项法律，允许政府印制纸币或“美元”。

That’s not to say that paper money was unavailable before then. Even as the U.S. government minted nothing but coins, private banks, often called “wildcats,” began issuing what in effect became thousands of currencies. Like the wartime continentals, these bank notes were in theory backed by gold, but it was hard to know whether a bank actually had enough gold to back up its notes, bank regulation being pretty much nonexistent at the time. Unsurprisingly, the wildcat era was fertile ground for fraud. What is surprising perhaps is that most banks did a reasonable job of keeping their currency and their gold reserves in balance, and the U.S. economy grew briskly.  
这并不是说在那之前没有纸币。即使美国政府只铸造硬币，通常被称为“野猫”的私人银行也开始发行实际上成千上万的货币。与战时大陆货币一样，这些纸币理论上以黄金为后盾，但很难知道银行是否真的有足够的黄金来支持其纸币，因为当时银行监管几乎不存在。不出所料，野猫时代是欺诈的沃土。也许令人惊讶的是，大多数银行在保持货币和黄金储备平衡方面做得相当合理，美国经济蓬勃发展。

The Bank of England, meanwhile, took a far more sober approach. In 1821, it [adopted the gold standard](https://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/golds.htm), promising to redeem its notes for gold upon request. As other countries followed suit, the gold standard became the general rule for developed economies. The discovery of major new gold fields over the course of the 19th century ensured that the money supply kept growing.  
与此同时，英格兰银行采取了更为冷静的方法。1821 年，它[采用了金本位制](https://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/golds.htm)，承诺根据要求将其纸币兑换成黄金。随着其他国家纷纷效仿，金本位制成为发达经济体的一般规则。19 世纪发现的主要新金矿确保了货币供应量的持续增长。

The gold standard, as it was intended to do, brought stability to prices and was enormously beneficial to property holders and lenders. However, it also brought deflation—that is, prices generally fell—because as countries’ populations and economies grew, their governments had no easy way to increase the money supply short of mining more gold, and so money in effect became more scarce. Deflation was hard on farmers and borrowers, who longed for a little inflation to help them with their debts; when money gradually loses some of its value, so, too, do people’s debts.  
正如其意图一样，金本位制为价格带来了稳定性，并为财产持有人和贷款人带来了巨大的利益。然而，它也带来了通货紧缩——也就是说，价格普遍下跌——因为随着各国人口和经济的增长，他们的政府如果不开采更多的黄金，就没有简单的方法来增加货币供应量，因此货币实际上变得更加稀缺。通货紧缩对农民和借款人来说是艰难的，他们渴望一点通货膨胀来帮助他们偿还债务;当货币逐渐失去一些价值时，人们的债务也会逐渐贬值。

The gold standard also didn’t prevent economies from falling into recession, and when they did—as during the worldwide slump known as the [Long Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression), which lasted from 1873 to 1896—adherence to the standard made it difficult to do any of the things that might have quickly set things right, like cutting interest rates or pumping more money into the economy. As a result, economies took a long time to recover from downturns.  
金本位制也没有阻止经济体陷入衰退，当它们陷入衰退时——就像在 1873 年至 1896 年持续的全球长期[萧条](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression)期间一样——遵守金本位制使得很难做任何可能很快纠正的事情，比如降低利率或向经济注入更多资金。因此，经济需要很长时间才能从衰退中恢复过来。

Of course, clever financial minds will always find an end run around the rules. Having a gold standard, it turns out, didn’t completely limit the growth of money. Banks could still make loans against their gold reserves, and they did so freely. Economic historians now believe that the amount of paper currency in circulation dwarfed the actual amount of gold and silver that banks had on hand. And so, while money was still tethered to gold in people’s minds, it had already begun to become unhooked.  
当然，聪明的金融头脑总能找到绕过规则的结局。事实证明，拥有金本位制并没有完全限制货币的增长。银行仍然可以用他们的黄金储备贷款，而且他们这样做是自由的。经济历史学家现在认为，流通中的纸币数量使银行手头的实际黄金和白银数量相形见绌。因此，虽然金钱在人们心目中仍然与黄金相连，但它已经开始脱离钩子。

**What finally derailed the** gold standard was World War I. Governments needed more money for their militaries than they had in gold, and so they simply began printing it. And though many countries [tried to return to the gold standard](https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/27/135604828/why-we-left-the-gold-standard) after the war, the Great Depression ended that experiment for good.  
**最终破坏**金本位制的是第一次世界大战。政府需要的军队资金比黄金还要多，因此他们干脆开始印钞。尽管许多国家在战后[试图恢复金本位制](https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/04/27/135604828/why-we-left-the-gold-standard)，但大萧条永远结束了这一实验。

The result? Currencies today are “fiat” currencies, meaning they’re backed by the authority of the issuing government, and nothing more. In the United States, for example, that means the government accepts only dollars as payment for taxes and requires its creditors to accept dollars in payment for debts. But if people were to lose faith in the dollar and stop accepting it in everyday transactions, it would eventually become worthless.  
结果如何？今天的货币是“法定”货币，这意味着它们得到了发行政府的权威支持，仅此而已。例如，在美国，这意味着政府只接受美元作为税款，并要求其债权人接受美元作为债务支付。但是，如果人们对美元失去信心，不再在日常交易中接受美元，它最终将变得一文不值。

Many people find this situation unnerving, which is why there are perennial calls to return to the gold standard. The reliance on fiat money, we’re told, gives too much power to the government, which can recklessly print as much money as it wants. Yet the truth is that this has always been possible. Even with the gold standard, governments revalued their currencies from time to time, in effect dictating a new price for gold, or they ignored the standard when it proved too limiting, as during the First World War.  
许多人觉得这种情况令人不安，这就是为什么人们常年呼吁回归金本位制的原因。我们被告知，对法定货币的依赖赋予了政府太多的权力，政府可以不计后果地印制它想要的钞票。然而，事实是，这一直是可能的。即使有金本位制，政府也会不时地重新评估本国货币，实际上是规定了黄金的新价格，或者当金本位制被证明过于有限时，他们就会忽视该本位制，就像第一次世界大战期间一样。

What’s more, the notion that gold is somehow more “real” than paper is, well, a mirage. Gold is valuable because we’ve collectively decided that it’s valuable and that we’ll accept goods and services in exchange for it. And that’s no different, ultimately, from our collective decision that colorful rectangles of paper are valuable and that we’ll accept goods and services in exchange for them.  
更重要的是，黄金在某种程度上比纸张更“真实”的概念是一个海市蜃楼。黄金之所以有价值，是因为我们已经共同决定它有价值，并且我们将接受商品和服务来换取它。最终，这与我们的集体决定没有什么不同，即彩色矩形纸很有价值，我们将接受商品和服务以换取它们。

The reality is that it’s a good thing that we’ve moved away from the gold standard and the idea that money needs to be tied to something else. In the first place, it’s honest: As soon as we left behind the habit of trading cattle for barley (both of which had intrinsic value), money became a social convention, and paper money just makes that convention obvious. These days, instead of worrying about where we’re going to find more gold and silver, we can focus on how to wisely manage the money supply for the greater good.  
现实情况是，我们已经摆脱了金本位制和货币需要与其他东西挂钩的想法，这是一件好事。首先，它是诚实的：一旦我们摒弃了用牛换大麦的习惯（两者都有内在价值），货币就成为一种社会习俗，而纸币只是使这种习俗变得明显。如今，与其担心在哪里可以找到更多的黄金和白银，不如专注于如何明智地管理货币供应量以实现更大的利益。

Second, and more important, abandoning the gold standard has given central banks much more flexibility in dealing with economic downturns. Recessions are downward spirals: Instead of spending and investing, people and businesses hold on to their cash, which shrinks overall demand, which forces businesses to cut back, which creates unemployment, which shrinks demand even more.  
其次，也是更重要的是，放弃金本位制使各国央行在应对经济衰退方面有了更大的灵活性。经济衰退是恶性循环：人们和企业没有消费和投资，而是持有现金，这缩小了总体需求，迫使企业削减开支，从而造成失业，从而进一步缩小需求。

One solution is for governments to make up the difference by spending more. But it’s also important for interest rates to drop and for the money supply to increase, thereby making it easier for people to borrow money and helping overcome their reluctance to spend. Such actions are easier for the folks at the Federal Reserve and other central banks to pull off when they don’t have to worry about maintaining the gold standard. And recessions have been shorter and less painful since the gold standard was abandoned. Even the most recent global downturn, severe as it was, was minor compared to the Great Depression.  
一种解决方案是政府通过增加支出来弥补差额。但利率下降和货币供应量增加也很重要，从而使人们更容易借钱并帮助克服他们不愿意消费的情绪。当美联储和其他央行的人不必担心维持金本位时，这样的行动更容易实现。自从放弃金本位制以来，衰退的时间更短，痛苦也更小。即使是最近的全球经济衰退，尽管很严重，但与大萧条相比也是微不足道的。

Of course, all this talk of central bankers tinkering with the money supply is precisely what critics of the fiat money system dread, because they believe it will inevitably lead to runaway inflation. And history does show that when a government massively and carelessly expands the money supply, it ends up with hyperinflation and a worthless currency, as happened in [Weimar Germany in 1923](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/hyperinflation_weimar_germany.htm)and in [Zimbabwe just a few years ago](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/3453540/Zimbabwe-hyperinflation-will-set-world-record-within-six-weeks.html).  
当然，所有这些关于央行行长修补货币供应量的言论正是法定货币体系的批评者所害怕的，因为他们认为这将不可避免地导致失控的通货膨胀。历史确实表明，当一个政府大规模地、粗心地扩大货币供应量时，它最终会导致恶性通货膨胀和一文不值的货币，就像 [1923 年的魏玛德国](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/hyperinflation_weimar_germany.htm)和[几年前的津巴布韦](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/3453540/Zimbabwe-hyperinflation-will-set-world-record-within-six-weeks.html)所发生的那样。

But such episodes are rare. In the past 90 years, the United States and Europe have had just one sustained bout of high inflation—in the 1970s. That track record should engender some faith; on the whole, central bankers act responsibly, and healthy industrial economies aren’t prone to regular inflationary spirals. But that faith is apparently hard to muster; instead, it feels to many of us as if inflation is always about to soar out of control.  
但这样的事件很少见。在过去的 90 年里，美国和欧洲只在 1970 年代经历了一次持续的高通胀。这样的记录应该会产生一些信心;总体而言，央行行长们的行为是负责任的，健康的工业经济体不容易出现定期的通胀螺旋式上升。但这种信念显然很难鼓起;相反，我们中的许多人感觉通货膨胀似乎总是要失控飙升。

This irrational fear is ultimately a legacy of the way money evolved: We cling to the belief that money needs to be backed by something “solid.” In that sense, we’re just like Marco Polo—still a bit amazed by the thought that you can base an entire economy on little pieces of paper.  
这种非理性的恐惧最终是货币进化方式的遗产：我们坚持认为货币需要有“坚实”的东西支持。从这个意义上说，我们就像马可·波罗一样——仍然对你可以将整个经济建立在小纸片上的想法感到有点惊讶。

And yet we do. For more than 80 years, we’ve been living in a world in which money can be created, in effect, out of thin air. As we’ve already discussed, the central banks can create money, but so can ordinary banks. When a bank makes a loan, it typically just puts the money into the borrower’s bank account, whether or not it has that money on hand—banks are allowed to lend more money than they have in their reserves. And so with each home equity loan, car loan, and mortgage, banks add incrementally to the money supply.  
然而，我们确实如此。80 多年来，我们一直生活在一个货币实际上可以凭空创造的世界。正如我们已经讨论过的，中央银行可以创造货币，但普通银行也可以。当银行发放贷款时，它通常只是将钱存入借款人的银行账户，无论它手头是否有这笔钱——银行可以借出比其准备金更多的钱。因此，对于每笔房屋净值贷款、汽车贷款和抵押贷款，银行都会逐步增加货币供应量。

There is, to be sure, something a bit eerie about all this, and periods like the recent housing bubble, when banks made an extraordinary number of bad loans, should remind us of the dangers of runaway credit. But it’s a mistake to yearn for a more “solid” foundation for the monetary system. Money is a social creation, just like language. It’s a tool that can be used well or poorly, and it’s preferable that we have more freedom to use that tool than less.  
可以肯定的是，这一切都有点怪异，像最近的房地产泡沫时期，银行发放了大量不良贷款，应该提醒我们信贷失控的危险。但渴望为货币体系建立一个更“坚实”的基础是错误的。金钱是一种社会创造，就像语言一样。这是一个可以使用得好或用得不好的工具，最好我们有更多的自由来使用该工具。

Over the course of history, the material substance of money has become less important, to the point that these days people talk easily about [the possibility of a cashless society](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-cash). The powerful combination of [computers and telecommunications](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/the-microsecond-market), of [smartphones and social media](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/theres-no-stopping-the-rise-of-emoney), of [cryptography](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/bitcoin-the-cryptoanarchists-answer-to-cash) and [virtual economies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/virtual-currency-gets-real), is what fuels such talk. And that progression makes sense because what matters most about money is not what it is, but what it does. Successful currencies, after all, are those that people use: They lubricate commerce, allow people to exchange goods and services, and thus encourage people to work and create. The German sociologist Georg Simmel described money as “pure interaction,” and that description seems apt—when money is working as it should, it is not so much a thing as it is a process.  
随着历史的发展，货币的物质实质变得不那么重要，以至于如今人们很容易谈论[无现金社会的可能性](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-cash)。[计算机和电信](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/the-microsecond-market)、[智能手机和社交媒体](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/theres-no-stopping-the-rise-of-emoney)、[密码学](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/bitcoin-the-cryptoanarchists-answer-to-cash)和[虚拟经济](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/virtual-currency-gets-real)的强大结合，是这种讨论的动力。这种进步是有道理的，因为金钱最重要的不是它是什么，而是它的作用。毕竟，成功的货币是人们使用的货币：它们润滑商业，让人们交换商品和服务，从而鼓励人们工作和创造。德国社会学家格奥尔格·西梅尔 （Georg Simmel） 将货币描述为“纯粹的互动”，这个描述似乎很贴切——当货币按应有的方式运作时，它与其说是一个东西，不如说是一个过程。

This, perhaps, is what Kublai Khan understood seven centuries ago. It’s what we’re still trying to understand today.  
这也许是忽必烈汗在七个世纪前所理解的。这就是我们今天仍在努力理解的。
