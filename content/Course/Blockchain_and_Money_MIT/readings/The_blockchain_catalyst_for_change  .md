The idea of a new software system that powers a consensus-driven form of shared record keeping has already had a profound effect, encouraging rapid and substantial investment in what is now commonly referred to as blockchain technology. This column introduces the latest Geneva Report on the World Economy, which assesses the available evidence and likely impact for this technology across a wide range of applications and explores the potential use cases for the financial sector, and the ways in which the organisation of these activities may change over time.

There could not have been a more propitiously timed release than that of Satoshi Nakamoto’s nine-page paper entitled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” (Nakamoto 2008). It landed on 31 October 2008, in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ collapse and with a global financial crisis in full force. Yet at the time it went more or less unnoticed in mainstream financial circles, preoccupied as they were with preventing the existing system from collapse.   
没有比中本聪题为“比特币：一种点对点电子现金系统”（Nakamoto 2008）的九页论文更恰当的发布时间了。它于 2008 年 10 月 31 日登陆，当时雷曼兄弟倒闭，全球金融危机全面爆发。然而，在当时，主流金融界或多或少没有注意到它，因为他们全神贯注于防止现有体系崩溃。

Now, a decade later, it’s clear that Satoshi’s contribution to finance must be taken seriously: a new software system that powers a consensus-driven form of shared record keeping – enabling the digital transfer of value in a decentralised manner.  (Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym and the identity of the author or authors remains unclear; people generally refer to this contribution by the fictitious first name.)  
现在，十年过去了，很明显，必须认真对待中本聪对金融的贡献：一个新的软件系统，为共识驱动的共享记录保存形式提供支持——以去中心化的方式实现价值的数字化转移。（Satoshi Nakamoto 是一个笔名，作者的身份尚不清楚;人们通常用虚构的名字来指代这个贡献。

In a sense, Satoshi’s contribution was not entirely new – the ‘distributed consensus’ problem Satoshi was proposing to solve is well-known.  This is the question of how multiple, independently run computers can reliably agree on a set of common data in the presence of faults, i.e. where there is a risk that one or more computers are intentionally or unintentionally programmed to introduce false information.  
从某种意义上说，中本聪的贡献并不是全新的——中本聪提议解决的“分布式共识”问题是众所周知的。这是一个问题，即在存在故障的情况下，即存在一台或多台计算机被有意或无意编程以引入虚假信息的风险，多台独立运行的计算机如何可靠地就一组公共数据达成一致。

In another sense, Bitcoin is a major breakthrough because participants are incentivised to select and validate transactions made in its native currency, bitcoin. Through that process, participants can agree upon a continually updated history of those transactions – without the need to trust third party intermediaries.    
从另一种意义上说，比特币是一个重大突破，因为参与者被激励选择和验证以其本币比特币进行的交易。通过该流程，参与者可以就这些交易的持续更新历史记录达成一致，而无需信任第三方中介机构。

Users control their bitcoin via a digital signature system by which they indicate consent to transfer coins. These digital signatures are public, cannot be forged, and can be verified by anyone.  It is important that there is only one version of the transaction ledger because in order to verify a payment, participants look at the ledger to validate that an amount of bitcoin has indeed been transferred. If there were different ledger histories, a malicious user might be able to ‘double spend’, i.e. transfer a single bitcoin more than once, as two payments.  
用户通过数字签名系统控制他们的比特币，通过该系统他们表示同意转移硬币。这些数字签名是公开的，不能伪造，任何人都可以验证。交易分类账只有一个版本很重要，因为为了验证付款，参与者会查看分类账以验证确实转移了一定数量的比特币。如果存在不同的账本历史记录，恶意用户可能会进行“双花”，即多次转移单个比特币，作为两次付款。

This simple and straightforward idea – and associated software code – has already had a profound effect, encouraging rapid and substantial investment in what is now commonly referred to as blockchain technology.  A blockchain is a consensus protocol used to create an append-only log (in the case of Bitcoin, a transaction ledger) that can then be used to form an auditable database (in Bitcoin, a record of who owns which coins). This database is constructed by multiple, possibly distrusting participants and is secured using cryptography so that every entry can be audited and verified.  
这个简单明了的想法——以及相关的软件代码——已经产生了深远的影响，鼓励对现在通常所说的区块链技术进行快速和大量的投资。区块链是一种共识协议，用于创建仅附加日志（在比特币的情况下，是交易分类账），然后可用于形成可审计的数据库（在比特币中，谁拥有哪些硬币的记录）。该数据库由多个可能不信任的参与者构建，并使用加密技术进行保护，以便可以审核和验证每个条目。

The result is a common, consensus-based record of transactions that is updated in real-time, one with broad potential applications, including for non-currency exchanges of value and data. In theory, such a system could end the need for costly, time-consuming reconciliation across separate, centralized ledgers run by multiple entities. It could also enable new forms of economic activity that were previously impossible in the absence of reliable, intermediating record-keepers.  
其结果是实时更新的通用、基于共识的交易记录，具有广泛的潜在应用，包括非货币价值和数据交换。从理论上讲，这样的系统可以消除由多个实体运行的单独集中式账本之间进行昂贵、耗时的对账的需要。它还可以实现以前在没有可靠的中介记录保存者的情况下不可能实现的新形式的经济活动。

We believe this technology could reduce the ingrained ‘cost of trust’ that currently adds friction to commerce and enriches trust-intermediating gatekeepers across the economy.  Blockchain developers agree. They are conceiving of a host of new potential uses: for cross-border payments, in clearing and settlement for financial transactions, for supply-chain management, for device-to-device transactions in the Internet of Things, to create more reliable property and asset registries, to forge portable digital identities, and to improve record-sharing in sensitive areas such as health care.   
我们相信，这项技术可以减少根深蒂固的“信任成本”，这种成本目前增加了商业摩擦，并丰富了整个经济中信任中介的守门人。区块链开发人员对此表示赞同。他们正在构思一系列新的潜在用途：跨境支付、金融交易的清算和结算、供应链管理、物联网中的设备到设备交易、创建更可靠的财产和资产登记、伪造便携式数字身份，以及改善医疗保健等敏感领域的记录共享。

However, even after nearly a decade, much remains unclear about precisely what form or forms of blockchains will prevail.  On the decentralised end are already functioning systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are permissionless – meaning there are no restrictions on who can join the system and participate in creating the ledger.  Currently, these open systems are constrained in their capacity to scale by a variety of technical obstacles. Innovative solutions to these problems are being pursued, with the goal of increasing transaction-processing capabilities and lowering overall computation requirements, but they are yet to be adequately proven in live environments. Traditional centralised databases avoid these constraints but rely on trusted entities. They are widely used today, and may still prevail in many areas, perhaps with some enhancements inspired by blockchain-based competitors.  In between are myriad developing – or potentially developing – permissioned blockchains, which have some degree of decentralisation without being open to all.  
然而，即使在近十年之后，关于区块链的确切形式或形式将占上风，仍有很多不清楚的地方。在去中心化的一端，比特币和以太坊等已经在运行的系统，它们是无需许可的——这意味着谁可以加入系统并参与创建账本没有限制。目前，这些开放系统的扩展能力受到各种技术障碍的限制。人们正在寻求这些问题的创新解决方案，以提高事务处理能力和降低整体计算要求，但它们尚未在实际环境中得到充分验证。传统的集中式数据库避免了这些限制，但依赖于受信任的实体。它们今天被广泛使用，并且可能仍然在许多领域盛行，也许受到基于区块链的竞争对手的一些增强。介于两者之间的是无数正在开发或可能正在开发的许可区块链，它们具有一定程度的去中心化，但不对所有人开放。

In the 21st [Geneva Report on the World Economy](https://voxeu.org/content/impact-blockchain-technology-finance-catalyst-change), we assess the available evidence and likely impact for this technology across a wide range of applications (Casey et al. 2018). We also explore in detail the potential use cases for the financial sector, and the ways in which the organisation of these activities may change over time.  
在第 21 届[日内瓦世界经济报告中](https://voxeu.org/content/impact-blockchain-technology-finance-catalyst-change)，我们评估了这项技术在广泛应用中的可用证据和可能影响（Casey 等人，2018 年）。我们还详细探讨了金融行业的潜在用例，以及这些活动的组织方式可能随着时间的推移而变化。

Executives who run intermediaries – in finance or anywhere else in the economy – are thinking about whether that role will prove sustainable as more decentralised forms of interaction spread.  And of course, many entrepreneurs are interested in challenging or even breaking down established forms of intermediation.  
经营中介机构的高管——无论是在金融领域还是经济中的其他任何地方——都在考虑，随着更加分散的互动形式的传播，这种角色是否会证明是可持续的。当然，许多企业家对挑战甚至打破既定的中介形式感兴趣。

Investors are drawn to the opportunity, and for obvious reasons.  The rise of internet giants, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, makes the point that the spread of digital technology can rapidly create new fortunes.    
投资者被这个机会所吸引，原因显而易见。谷歌、Facebook 和亚马逊等互联网巨头的崛起表明，数字技术的传播可以迅速创造新的财富。

Without question, blockchain technologies have grabbed headlines – and attracted capital – in part because developers latched onto not just the decentralised nature of Bitcoin, but also the more general idea that investors can participate by buying what have become known as ‘coins’.  
毫无疑问，区块链技术占据了头条新闻——并吸引了资本——部分原因是开发人员不仅抓住了比特币的去中心化性质，还抓住了投资者可以通过购买所谓的“硬币”来参与的更普遍的想法。

The full legal issues are – as with all such matters – fascinating to specialists but a little hard for non-specialists to grasp fully; our Geneva report attempts to provide an accessible guide.  
与所有此类问题一样，完整的法律问题对专家来说很吸引人，但对于非专业人士来说，要完全掌握有点困难;我们的日内瓦报告试图提供一个通俗易懂的指南。

Exactly how this plays out will matter, for the development of this new activity and potentially for the economy as a whole.  Over 3,000 ‘initial coin offerings’ (ICOs) have been published to date, with cumulative capital raised close to $20 billion.  (Figures 1 and 2 show the most reliable recent data, which is published by CoinDesk; two authors of the Geneva report are advisors to CoinDesk.)  
具体如何发展对于这项新活动的发展以及整个经济都可能至关重要。迄今为止，已发布超过 3,000 个“首次代币发行”（ICO），累计筹集资金近 200 亿美元。（图 1 和图 2 显示了 CoinDesk 发布的最新数据;Geneva 报告的两位作者是 CoinDesk 的顾问。

At the time of writing, the total crypto asset market was valued at approximately $250 billion, with 57% of that value in tokens other than bitcoin.  There are at least 200 crypto-exchanges operating with tens of millions of customers worldwide.  
在撰写本文时，加密资产市场的总价值约为 2500 亿美元，其中 57% 的价值是比特币以外的代币。至少有 200 家加密货币交易所运营，在全球拥有数千万客户。

Regulators are forced to take a view in this situation (Carney 2018).  Innovation is important and it has generally bolstered economic development when countries have been supportive – as was the case with the development of the internet.  We generally get more new products, better value for consumers, and more good jobs when sensible innovation is allowed to incur.  
监管机构被迫在这种情况下采取看法（Carney 2018）。创新很重要，当各国提供支持时，它通常会促进经济发展——就像互联网的发展一样。当允许明智的创新时，我们通常会获得更多的新产品，为消费者带来更好的价值，并获得更多的好工作。

At the same time, however, the recent wave of ICOs – and the general investing frenzy in this space – has attracted significant fraud and abuse.  One study in February of 2018 found that 59% of a sample of 2017 ICOs had already failed or semi-failed (Morris 2018).  (In the Geneva report, we unpack in some detail exactly what is known from those cases that have been investigated, for example by the Securities and Exchange Commission.)  
然而，与此同时，最近的 ICO 浪潮——以及该领域的普遍投资狂潮——吸引了严重的欺诈和滥用。2018 年 2 月的一项研究发现，59 年 2017 次 ICO 样本中有 2017% 已经失败或半失败（Morris 2018）。（在日内瓦报告中，我们详细地揭示了从那些已经调查的案件中了解到的信息，例如美国证券交易委员会（Securities and Exchange Commission）。

In our assessment, for blockchain technologies to reach their potential – both in terms of applications as well as for investing – they need to be more fully brought within public policy and legal frameworks.  Clear rules of the road today will allow firms – both incumbents and start-ups – to more fully explore investing in crypto assets, token applications or other blockchain technology.  Key points include full and fair disclosure to participants in investment schemes – in particular promoting transparency – and rules against fraud and manipulation in crypto markets.    
根据我们的评估，区块链技术要想发挥其潜力——无论是在应用还是投资方面——都需要将它们更充分地纳入公共政策和法律框架。今天明确的道路规则将使公司（包括现有企业和初创企业）能够更充分地探索投资加密资产、代币应用或其他区块链技术。关键点包括向投资计划的参与者进行全面和公平的披露（特别是提高透明度）以及反对加密市场欺诈和操纵的规则。

There is also wide agreement that these new markets and technologies must not be allowed to undermine financial stability (Financial Stability Board 2018), with central banks and finance ministries currently discussing how much risk cryptocurrencies, other crypto assets, and blockchain applications might pose in that realm.  There also need to be appropriate safeguards against illicit activity – including money laundering and terrorism finance – and tax avoidance.  
人们还普遍认为，绝不能允许这些新市场和技术破坏金融稳定（金融稳定委员会 2018 年），中央银行和财政部目前正在讨论加密货币、其他加密资产和区块链应用可能在该领域构成多少风险。还需要采取适当的保护措施来防止非法活动（包括洗钱和恐怖主义融资）和避税。

Market participants, the investing public, entrepreneurs, technology developers, regulators and political leaders should all play a role. In particular, organisations conducting token sales through ICOs and crypto-exchange operators should now seek to comply with the law to the fullest extent possible.  We are hopeful that there will be moves in this direction.   
市场参与者、投资大众、企业家、技术开发商、监管机构和政治领导人都应该发挥作用。特别是，通过 ICO 进行代币销售的组织和加密货币交易所运营商现在应寻求尽可能充分地遵守法律。我们希望会朝着这个方向前进。

It is too early to precisely forecast the impact of blockchain technology – or even whether change will come through the creation of entirely new structures or because existing intermediaries are forced to innovate.  Either way, blockchain technology has real potential as a catalyst for change in the world of finance – and much more broadly.  
现在准确预测区块链技术的影响还为时过早，甚至预测变化是否会通过创建全新的结构来实现，或者因为现有的中介机构被迫创新。无论哪种方式，区块链技术都具有真正的潜力，可以成为金融领域变革的催化剂，而且范围更广。
