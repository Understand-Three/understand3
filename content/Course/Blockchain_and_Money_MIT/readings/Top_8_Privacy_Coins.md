[April 16, 2018](https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-privacy-coins/ "April 16, 2018") [By Steven White](https://www.investinblockchain.com/author/steven/ "By Steven White")[四月 16， 2018](https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-privacy-coins/ "April 16, 2018") [作者 Steven White](https://www.investinblockchain.com/author/steven/ "By Steven White") 

It’s a common misconception that [**Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-cryptocurrencies/ "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies") are fully anonymous and untraceable. In fact, many blockchains only disguise users’ identities while leaving behind a public record of all transactions that have occurred on the blockchain. The data in the ledger often includes how many tokens a user has received or sent in historical transactions, as well as the balance of any cryptocurrency that they have within their wallet.  
一个常见的误解是[**比特币和其他加密货币**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-cryptocurrencies/ "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies")是完全匿名且无法追踪的。事实上，许多区块链只是伪装用户的身份，同时留下区块链上发生的所有交易的公共记录。账本中的数据通常包括用户在历史交易中接收或发送的代币数量，以及他们钱包中任何加密货币的余额。

There is a concern that even with their identities disguised, users can still be identified based on their activity within a blockchain. This is why some people turn to privacy coins – cryptocurrencies that provide users with a higher level of anonymity.  
人们担心，即使伪装了用户的身份，仍然可以根据他们在区块链中的活动来识别用户。这就是为什么有些人转向隐私币的原因——为用户提供更高级别匿名性的加密货币。

Although controversial (some authorities see privacy-oriented coins as an illicit tool that can be used by criminals to engage in illegal activities, such as money laundering), privacy coins are the safest way for users to make [**blockchain transactions**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/best-practices-cryptocurrency-transactions/ "blockchain transactions") without their financial details being exposed to the public. These platforms typically have several privacy-centric functions, like stealth addresses or private transactions, which can be used to hide user information on blockchains.  
尽管存在争议（一些权威机构将面向隐私的硬币视为犯罪分子可以用来从事非法活动（例如洗钱）的非法工具），但隐私币是用户进行[**区块链交易**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/best-practices-cryptocurrency-transactions/ "blockchain transactions")的最安全方式，而不会将他们的财务详细信息暴露给公众。这些平台通常具有一些以隐私为中心的功能，例如隐身地址或私人交易，可用于在区块链上隐藏用户信息。

If you’re interested in learning more about privacy coins, here are our top 8 favorites that are currently available on the market.  
如果您有兴趣了解有关隐私币的更多信息，以下是我们目前市场上排名前 8 位的最爱。

## **Monero 门罗币**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/monero_logo.png)

[**Monero**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-monero/ "Monero") was launched in 2014, and since then it has grown to become one of the most stable and secure privacy coins released to date. Their cryptocurrency platform is the product of a Bitcoin fork but, unlike Bitcoin, Monero was created with several anonymity features. Monero effectively allows its users to have a firm command over the privacy of their data by keeping transaction information completely anonymous within the blockchain.  
[**门罗币**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-monero/ "Monero")于 2014 年推出，从那时起，它已发展成为迄今为止发布的最稳定、最安全的隐私币之一。他们的加密货币平台是比特币分叉的产物，但与比特币不同的是，门罗币具有多种匿名功能。门罗币通过在区块链中保持交易信息完全匿名，有效地允许其用户牢牢掌握其数据的隐私。

Monero has a few unique features that helped it grow to become the top contender in the privacy coin market.  
门罗币有一些独特的功能，帮助它成长为隐私币市场的顶级竞争者。

#### **Ring Signatures 戒指签名**

A ring signature is a digital signature that is created by bringing a group of signers together. Monero uses this digital signature to bring multiple signers (usually 5) into each transaction. Only the sender is able to generate and send the spend key, and only the actual recipient will be able to detect the key and spend the funds linked to it. With a ring signature in place, it is impossible to link any transaction back to any one user, offering a high grade of privacy.  
环形签名是通过将一组签名者聚集在一起而创建的数字签名。门罗币使用此数字签名将多个签名者（通常为 5 个）带入每笔交易。只有发送者能够生成和发送 spend key，并且只有实际的接收者才能检测到密钥并花费与之关联的资金。有了环签名，就不可能将任何交易链接回任何一个用户，从而提供高度的隐私。

#### **Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)   
Ring 机密事务 （RingCT）**

This feature hides the amount of each transaction on Monero’s network. RingCT works by creating cryptographic proof that can show that the input and output amounts are equal, without revealing any of the actual numbers.  
此功能隐藏了门罗币网络上每笔交易的金额。RingCT 的工作原理是创建加密证明，该证明可以显示输入和输出量相等，而无需透露任何实际数字。

#### **Stealth Addresses  Stealth 地址**

Monero also uses a network of stealth addresses to allow users to disconnect themselves from the blockchain. A stealth address is a one-time use address that is created for every transaction. Monero users also have a public address that is published on the blockchain, but most (if not all) of their transactions will be passed through unique stealth addresses.  
门罗币还使用隐形地址网络来允许用户断开自己与区块链的连接。隐形地址是为每笔交易创建的一次性地址。门罗币用户也有一个发布在区块链上的公共地址，但他们的大部分（如果不是全部）交易将通过唯一的隐形地址传递。

With these inherently straightforward and easy to understand features, Monero has managed to remain relevant in the crypto space while offering users a completely untraceable cryptocurrency platform.  
凭借这些固有的简单易懂的功能，门罗币成功地在加密领域保持相关性，同时为用户提供了一个完全无法追踪的加密货币平台。

(Opinion)")**”。

## **Zcash Zcash 代币**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ZCash-Logo.png)

[**Zcash**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/zcash-what-the-future-holds/ "Zcash") is another Bitcoin-forked privacy coin, but it only has a handful of privacy features. The primary privacy feature that Zcash uses is zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs).  
[**Zcash**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/zcash-what-the-future-holds/ "Zcash") 是另一种比特币分叉的隐私币，但它只有少数隐私功能。Zcash 使用的主要隐私功能是零知识简洁的非交互式知识证明论证 （zk-SNARKs）。

That name may be a mouthful to pronounce, but the basic functionality that this privacy method offers is simple to articulate. zk-SNARKS encrypt all transactional data that is stored on the network. This method verifies that the data being exchanged is accurate, but it does so without revealing all of the transaction details.  
这个名字可能听起来很拗口，但这种隐私方法提供的基本功能很容易表达。zk-SNARKS 加密存储在网络上的所有交易数据。此方法验证正在交换的数据是否准确，但它不会泄露所有交易详细信息。

But it is important to note that using these privacy features is optional, as users can opt for transparent (public) or private addresses. Some critics believe that users choosing not to activate the privacy features may compromise the overall security of the entire network.  
但需要注意的是，使用这些隐私功能是可选的，因为用户可以选择透明（公共）或私有地址。一些批评者认为，用户选择不激活隐私功能可能会危及整个网络的整体安全性。

## **Dash 破折号**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dash-Logo.png)Dash is a bit different from the previously mentioned coins. Founded after a Bitcoin fork in 2014, it is an open-source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that offers many of the same features as [**Bitcoin**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-bitcoin/ "Bitcoin"). But in addition to Bitcoin’s core features, Dash also includes the option for instant and private transactions.  
Dash 与前面提到的硬币有点不同。它在 2014 年比特币分叉后成立，是一种开源的点对点加密货币，提供许多与[**比特币**](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-bitcoin/ "Bitcoin")相同的功能。但除了比特币的核心功能外，Dash 还包括即时和私人交易的选项。

To ensure the integrity of their system, the developers of Dash chose to implement a Proof-of-Stake protocol as well. This part of the system is designed to provide additional support to the miners that validate transactions on the first tier of the service.  
为了确保系统的完整性，Dash 的开发人员还选择实施权益证明协议。系统的这一部分旨在为在服务的第一层验证交易的矿工提供额外的支持。

Masternodes are introduced to the network for the purpose of validating transactions on the second tier of the service, which facilitates private and instant transactions as well as governance features. In order to run a masternode, a user must have at least 1,000 tokens in their wallet.  
主节点被引入网络是为了验证服务第二层的交易，这促进了私人和即时交易以及治理功能。为了运行主节点，用户的钱包中必须至少有 1,000 个代币。

The instant-send function sends transactions along the 2nd tier of the Dash blockchain, allowing them to be confirmed quickly.  
即时发送功能沿着达世币区块链的第二层发送交易，使交易能够快速得到确认。

Private transactions are sent using the CoinJoin method. This method consists of attaching transactions together to make “joint payments.” But unlike a traditional joint payment, the value that was exchanged by each party and the place that the payment ended up are completely undiscoverable by third parties.  
私有交易使用 CoinJoin 方法发送。这种方法包括将交易附加在一起以进行“联合支付”。但与传统的联合付款不同的是，第三方完全无法发现各方交换的价值和付款的最终地点。

## **PIVX PIVX普维币**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pivx.png)

[**PIVX**](https://pivx.org/zpiv/ "PIVX") is another new privacy coin that works similar to Dash, but operates on Proof-of-Stake rather than Proof-of-Work. PIVX users are allowed to run master nodes which help keep the network running smoothly. Commanding one of these nodes requires a stake of at least 10,000 tokens (in comparison, Dash only requires 1,000 DASH). With this much higher threshold, PIVX has more of its available token supply tied up in various master nodes.  
[**PIVX**](https://pivx.org/zpiv/ "PIVX") 是另一种新的隐私币，其工作原理类似于 Dash，但基于权益证明而不是工作量证明运行。PIVX 普维币用户可以运行主节点，这有助于保持网络平稳运行。指挥其中一个节点需要至少 10,000 个代币的质押（相比之下，达世币只需要 1,000 个 DASH）。有了这个更高的阈值，PIVX普维币有更多的可用代币供应被各种主节点所束缚。

PIVX has fast transaction verification, and supports both private and instant transactions. Transactions can be made completely anonymous, preventing discovery of a person’s real-world identity by analyzing the blockchain.  
PIVX 普维币具有快速的交易验证功能，并支持私人和即时交易。交易可以完全匿名，通过分析区块链来防止发现一个人的真实身份。

At the time of writing, the block time is about 60 seconds. Transaction fees are also quite small. These qualities make PIVX a worthy mention in the privacy coin conversation.  
在撰写本文时，区块时间约为 60 秒。交易费用也相当小。这些品质使PIVX普维币在隐私币的对话中值得一提。

## **NavCoin NavCoin 公司**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Artboard-7-copy-1.png)NavCoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that was forked from Bitcoin. It aims to solve 2 problems that are typically found in blockchain platforms:  
NavCoin 是从比特币分叉而来的去中心化加密货币。它旨在解决区块链平台中常见的 2 个问题：

- Data is made public on the blockchain, leaving it vulnerable to malicious attacks by illicit users.  
    数据在区块链上公开，使其容易受到非法用户的恶意攻击。
- Most blockchains use “roll backs” as the solution to data vulnerability. They reset the blockchain to a backed-up point after a data breach, meaning transactions made leading up to the roll back are erased.  
    大多数区块链使用 “回滚” 作为数据漏洞的解决方案。他们在数据泄露后将区块链重置为备份点，这意味着导致回滚的交易将被擦除。

The NavTech system is a combination of the traditional Bitcoin blockchain and a NAV subchain. Using two chains allows users to send transactions with complete anonymity.  
NavTech 系统是传统比特币区块链和 NAV 子链的组合。使用两条链允许用户以完全匿名的方式发送交易。

Over the course of 2017, NAV managed to achieve significant growth and now manages a community of more than 50,000 users. Through 2018, they are aiming to implement a platform for building blockchain applications within the network. In addition to that goal, they also hope to add support for instant exchanges across different currencies.  
在 2017 年期间，NAV 实现了显著增长，现在管理着一个拥有超过 50,000 名用户的社区。到 2018 年，他们的目标是实施一个在网络内构建区块链应用程序的平台。除了这个目标之外，他们还希望增加对不同货币之间即时兑换的支持。

## **CloakCoin 披风币**

![cloakcoin](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cloakcoin.png)

Cloak is a veteran privacy coin that is growing slowly, although it has been active in the privacy niche for approximately 4 years. The blockchain is operated using a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol. It has relatively short blocktimes and quickly processes transactions.  
Cloak 是一种老牌隐私币，尽管它已经在隐私领域活跃了大约 4 年，但它增长缓慢。区块链使用权益证明共识协议运行。它的区块时间相对较短，可以快速处理交易。

The platform also offers 2 different methods of making your transactions untraceable.First is their onion-routing privacy protocol. Onion routing involves encrypting messages with many layers (similar to an onion).  
该平台还提供 2 种不同的方法来使您的交易无法追踪。首先是他们的洋葱路由隐私协议。洋葱路由涉及加密具有多个层（类似于洋葱）的消息。

It also offers the Enigma process to provide additional privacy cloaking on transactions. Enigma cloaking is applied when a user requests a cloaked enigma transaction. These transactions are carried across dedicated Enigma nodes, which are designed to cloak transaction data by shuffling it with other random data. Only these Enigma nodes are able to identify if the input and output data is accurate.  
它还提供 Enigma 流程，以在交易中提供额外的隐私隐藏。当用户请求隐藏的 enigma 事务时，将应用 enigma 伪装。这些交易通过专用的 Enigma 节点进行，这些节点旨在通过与其他随机数据混组来隐藏交易数据。只有这些 Enigma 节点能够识别输入和输出数据是否准确。

## **Enigma 谜**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/enigma-coin-e1523862189429.jpg)  
The Enigma project is entirely separate from the Enigma cloaking process used in CloakCoin transactions. Enigma is not a cryptocurrency nor a blockchain; instead, it is a privacy protocol that can be deployed on blockchains and decentralized applications. Therefore its token, ENG, is a distinct addition to the list of top privacy coins.  
Enigma 项目与 CloakCoin 披风币交易中使用的 Enigma 伪装过程完全分开。Enigma 不是加密货币也不是区块链;相反，它是一个可以部署在区块链和去中心化应用程序上的隐私协议。因此，它的代币 ENG 是顶级隐私币列表中的一个明显补充。

The Enigma network provides privacy by making nodes unable to see the data that they compute. Although they are unable to clearly see exactly what they are working on, these nodes are still capable of verifying that their computations have been run correctly. With the data masked like this, Enigma hopes to open the door for what they call a new type of smart contracts – “secret contracts” – wherein the underlying data processed in a smart contract remains encrypted at all times.  
Enigma 网络通过使节点无法看到它们计算的数据来提供隐私。尽管它们无法清楚地看到自己正在做什么，但这些节点仍然能够验证其计算是否已正确运行。通过对数据进行这样的屏蔽，Enigma 希望为他们所谓的新型智能合约——“秘密合约”——打开大门，其中智能合约中处理的底层数据始终保持加密。

Enigma’s token must be purchased in order to run a node on their network. After buying the Enigma token, you can receive rewards for processing data. But in order to process data, each node must make a security deposit. If the data is tampered during the verification process, the deposit will be split between any nodes that processed the data without error.  
必须购买 Enigma 的代币才能在其网络上运行节点。购买 Enigma 代币后，您可以获得处理数据的奖励。但为了处理数据，每个节点都必须支付保证金。如果数据在验证过程中被篡改，则存款将在处理数据的任何节点之间分配，而不会出错。

In effect, owning ENG allows people to get started using the network. ENG also serves as a reward for participation in the network.  
实际上，拥有 ENG 可以让人们开始使用该网络。ENG 还可以作为参与网络的奖励。

## **DeepOnion 深度洋葱**

![](https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/deeponion.png)  
DeepOnion is a new privacy coin project that is generating some interest in the community. Like a few of the other coins in this list, DeepOnion uses TOR to send untraceable transactions. It also uses a mix of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work protocols to offer fast confirmation times.  
DeepOnion 是一个新的隐私币项目，在社区中引起了一些兴趣。与此列表中的其他一些硬币一样，DeepOnion 使用 TOR 发送无法追踪的交易。它还混合使用权益证明和工作量证明协议来提供快速的确认时间。

DeepOnion also employs stealth addresses to keep transactions private. As mentioned before, a stealth address allows the sender to use a one-time user address for their transactions. The recipient only needs a single address, but before they receive the value that is sent, that block is sent to unique addresses on the chain where they cannot be connected to the sender or recipient’s personal address. This ensures that only the sender and receiver can consistently know where payments originated and where they were sent.  
DeepOnion 还使用隐形地址来保持交易的私密性。如前所述，隐形地址允许发件人使用一次性用户地址进行交易。接收者只需要一个地址，但在他们收到发送的值之前，该区块被发送到链上的唯一地址，他们无法连接到发送者或接收者的个人地址。这确保了只有发送方和接收方才能始终了解付款的来源和发送位置。

The DeepOnion team is currently working on DeepSend and DeepVault. DeepSend will use a multi-signature method to prevent payments from being traced. DeepVault is an information storage service that allows users to store data in the blockchain forever. To be more precise, DeepVault allows users to store hashes of files within the blockchain. In order to verify the integrity of a file, a user only needs to compare their current version of the file with the backup. This can be beneficial for the purpose of verifying the integrity of important documents.  
DeepOnion 团队目前正在开发 DeepSend 和 DeepVault。DeepSend 将使用多重签名方法来防止付款被追踪。DeepVault 是一种信息存储服务，允许用户将数据永久存储在区块链中。更准确地说，DeepVault 允许用户在区块链中存储文件的哈希值。为了验证文件的完整性，用户只需将其文件的当前版本与备份文件进行比较。这对于验证重要文档的完整性是有益的。

As the community develops, DeepOnion will also launch their VoteCentral function. It will allow users of the platform to vote on new developments and present their ideas for future projects. This project is small now, but in some regards it does show promise.  
随着社区的发展，DeepOnion 还将推出他们的 VoteCentral 功能。它将允许该平台的用户对新的发展进行投票，并提出他们对未来项目的想法。这个项目现在很小，但在某些方面它确实显示出希望。

## **Conclusion 结论**

Privacy coins are a niche group of cryptocurrencies. Some people may have no concerns about whether their transaction history is discoverable by third parties. But others might adamantly refuse to participate in any cryptocurrency platform that cannot guarantee them complete privacy.  
隐私币是一组小众加密货币。有些人可能不担心他们的交易历史记录是否会被第三方发现。但其他人可能会坚决拒绝参与任何无法保证他们完全隐私的加密货币平台。

If you are interested in investing in blockchain but have concerns about personal privacy, consider getting started with some of the privacy coins mentioned here.
